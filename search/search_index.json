Restore \u00b6 Restore dependencies for debian.8-x64 and win10-x64 using dotnet restore and Paket.

It does this using the Release configuration. Pack \u00b6 Packs the solution using Paket in Release mode and places the result in the dist folder.

The result is tagged as latest and with the current version number. DockerLogin \u00b6 Executes ci-docker-login.sh , which does an aws ecr login to login to Amazon Elastic Container Registry. This uses the local aws settings, make sure they are working!
